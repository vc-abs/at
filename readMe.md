# Astrology Trial

	A trial of some existing astrology packages to find auspicious times.


## ToDO
* Introduce proper package management.
* Make the configuration a bit more human readable.
* Support DMS notation for latitudes and longitudes.
* Rename this package to Auspicious Times.
* Standardize quotation marks.
* Try to bring some tools to help with code standardization.

## Notes
* The preferred ayanamsa is "ay_raman" as it's closer to the Pushya at 16Cn, suggested by PVN Rao.
